# Version Control (Git) 🎉

Welcome to **Acode Version Control (Git) Plugin**! 🚀

This plugin is a lightweight solution for those of you who love coding in Acode and need version control right in the editor. With this plugin, you can manage Git without having to switch between apps. 😎

#### Update v1.0.1: Fix SAF URI and Termux Path Issues
#### Update v1.0.2: You can now choose a folder location before cloning a repository.
#### 🆕 Update v1.1.0

## 🤔 How It Works

This plugin is built with [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) and leverages Acode's `fsOperation` API for a custom file system integration. Big thanks to the developers of isomorphic-git for making Git operations in JavaScript a reality. 🙌

## 🚧 Limitations

Okay, let’s be real—this plugin isn’t perfect. Here are some current limitations:

1. **Performance Issues**: It can be slow, especially for large repositories.
2. **Not Recommended for Big Repos**: If your repository is huge, you might want to use a dedicated Git client.

But i’m working on it! I’m exploring ways to improve performance and make it better. If you have ideas or contributions to make this plugin faster and more efficient, feel free to jump in.
